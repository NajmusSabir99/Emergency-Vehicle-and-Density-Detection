Emergency Vehicle Detection & Density Dataset ðŸš¨

This repository contains the dataset used in our project Emergency Vehicle Detection and Traffic Density Estimation via Webcam, where we trained a YOLO-based model on custom-collected data.

The dataset includes emergency vehicles such as ambulance, fire truck, along with normal vehicles, annotated for object detection and density analysis.
